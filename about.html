  <p1> Welcome to my About Page! My name is John Doorenbos, and I am currently a second year student at Luther College! In my somewhat limited free time, I enjoy biking, baking, hiking, making, from summiting the Golden Hind to zesting a lemon rind. Majoring in Physics and Computer Science, I take great pleasure in problem solving. However, what really interests me is knowing what makes things tick. It's not uncommon to find me seemingly staring off into the distance only to find that I am musing about the innerworkings of the latest cereal box surprise. </p1>
